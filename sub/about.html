    <h1>About Kimchi</h1>
    <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean 
        dish made from fermented vegetables, 
        primarily cabbage and radishes, with the addition 
        of various seasonings. It is a staple in Korean 
        cuisine and is often served as a side dish with meals. 
        The most common type of kimchi is made with napa cabbage, 
        known as "baechu kimchi," but there are numerous regional 
        and seasonal variations. </p>
